Asynchronous non-blocking code

Why Node asynchronous operations
Asynchronous code and callbacks
Dealing with computational blockers

Node.js is designed to address I/O scalability, not computational scalability
I/O= Input/ output.....interacting with databases/files
computational= complicated functions that can slow the process down
